# TODO: I have a similar script not specific to Makefiles called 'acquire';
# cull or refactor common functionality.

# TODO: Make this more robust when used as a wrapper for GNU Make: also check
# for makefile and GNUmakefile, perform search only if '--find' is specified
# (as our functionality conflicts with '-f Makefile'.)
