# When I use ssh+svn: to this box, use my subversion repository folder as the
# "root" to shorten subversion repository URLs.
#
# For this to work, this script must be discoverable in the path before
# /usr/bin/svnserve. For example, in .bashrc: export PATH=~/bin:$PATH

/usr/bin/svnserve -r ~/var/svn/ "$@"
