# I don't like that after I 'activate' a virtualenv, I can't jump into a screen
# session and have all the subshells also 'active.' I don't like that I can't
# just exit my current shell to 'deactivate'. I wish virtualenv "environments"
# worked more like the ssh-agent script, and that using a 'virtualenv' felt
# more like ssh-ing into a virtual server.
#
# TODO: create a script which accomplishes the same purpose as virtualenv's
# "activate", but launches the command passed as its argument with the new
# environment. Ending the command 'deactivates' the environment.
#
# This enables useage like: 
#
# 	invirtualenv ~/var/virtualenvs/test1 screen
