# This is a facade pattern to the various dynamic hook scripts involved in
# networking on a Debian linux box. The hook system is a good one but I prefer
# to keep all my firewalling rules in one file. This script currently carries
# no actual rules or calls out to iptables, but instead serves as a model of
# how to determine what's going on based on the environment. 
#
# This script can be symlinked to:
#   /etc/network/if-<option>.d/<whatever>
#   /etc/dhclient-exit-hooks
# Planned:
#   /etc/init.d/<whatever>
