# Collect data from a pipe in a temporary file and pass that file as an argument to the command given in arguments.

# Example:
# 	ls | giveto google-chrome

# For commands that do not wait, like spawning a new window in a running
# browser. FIXME: this may be annoyying for commands that DO wait; find an
# elegant solution.
